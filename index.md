# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/Mayshro/Seoul-Bike-Rental-LinearRegression-Updated)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

- **Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn

- **Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

- **Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in 56% accuracy .

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Prediction of user interest using bank data](https://github.com/Mayshro/Bank-Marketing-Analysis-LogisticRegression-Updated)

<img src="images/bank image.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project you will be provided with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in 87% accuracy using Logistic Regression and SMOTE .

- in this project we are given real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

[Amazon Fine Food Analysis using NLP](https://github.com/Mayshro/Amazon-fine-food-review-SentimentAnalysis--NLP-updated)

<img src="images/amazon.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, TfidVectorizer

**Project Objective:** Given a review, determine whether the review is positive or negative based on Amazon foods .

**Quantifiable result:** We could We could use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be cosnidered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) 

[**AUC** Score of 97%](https://github.com/Mayshro](https://github.com/Mayshro/Amazon-fine-food-review-SentimentAnalysis--NLP-updated)
- Given a review, it is determined whether the review is positive or negative.
- Used NLP for this approach.
- A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored.
